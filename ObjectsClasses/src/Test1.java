/*
Correct Answer. Both of these statements are invalid. Line 1 is an invalid declaration statement,
because b1 is not considered initialized in this statement
when it is assigned to a1 (Declarators - or declaration statements -
are processed in order from left to right in a compound statement).
Line 2 is an invalid declaration statement because it's not actually
a compound declaration statement, because b2 is not actually
declared in this statement and therefore you get a compiler error
that that b2 cannot be resolved.
